## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS
- CSS animate
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript
  
### File System

Component approach is used in this challange for better readable code, so the project was splited into pages and each page with components, the target was to make components that fit into one viewport of a 13" of a laptop screen.
